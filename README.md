# riley-aaron-site
A website created to display content for my music. I had created this webpage to have a site where fans or new listeners can go to my artist page. The site contains three pages,
an "enter site" page, a "main" page has; a brief bio, embedded song links, and a contact for my artist email, and a "listen now" media player that cycles through three of my songs.
This site is used to display all the knowledge that i've learned through Code Louisville courses and further knowledge that i've learned from tech events and online resources.

The 3 requirements that i've implemented are:
CSS: Use of Flexbox containers to rearrange elements on my screen as the size changes
CSS: Creating an animation on my nav bar under the psuedo-class "hover" a small bar goes across my li elements to show the user which link they're highlighting
JavaScript: Created an event listener that displays song title, progress bar, and cover art animation when the "play" button is clicked on "listen now" page.

Further notes:
My MP3 player is incomplete, I was unable to correctly troubleshoot the audio bug that wouldn't source the MP3 files in my project correctly. Luckly, this isn't 
requirement-breaking as my JavaScript shows and hides elements on my "listen now" page. The MP3 player is capable of all of it's visual needs, and can cycle through 
the song array with the "previous" and "next" buttons that i've achieved through using Font Awesome's CDN and JavaScript programming.
